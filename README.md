# Auction Information System

This project was designed for Data Structures and Algorithms 1. The program manages an auction system and lets the user manage items for auction in the system.
The user manages various functions of an auction such as posting new items to the auction, bidding on items, selling items and removing items.
The program was co-developed with Dean Lonergan.
